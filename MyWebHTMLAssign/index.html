    My name is Ibrahim Sorba Kargbo.
    I am a Sierra Leonean born in Lungi PortLoko District, Northwest part of Sierra Leonean.
    I was born in an extended family and my beloved parents are yet to kick the bucket. I love my parents so much that I dislike distancing myself from them.

    I am a guy with integrity, dignity and cool lifestyle. I am a friend to many and so also many are friends to me.
    I was so passionate on learning technology since I was a boy.
